# Recommendation

- Check the `01_minimal` and `02_many_pages` directory first.
- If you are familiar with spa development in elm, check the `03_spa_with_url_control` directory.
- If you are interested in what the boilerplates are doing, check the source code of `Page` module.
- After that, if you need the `Page` with an ability for emitting `Msg` to the main application other than `port`, see `../../Emitter` directory.
