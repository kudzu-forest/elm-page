# Page

This module allows you to handle various types of pages written in the same way as `Browser.element`, unified under a single type `Page` without type variables (it's just `Page`, not `Page model msg`). All the `Page`s can be gathered together to form a `List Page`, `Dict String Page`, `Random.Generator Page`, or any other data collection you prefer. This makes it much easier to create a single-page application from the source code of a multi-page app.

Be sure to check out the examples in [the GitHub repository]().
